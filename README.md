# About

The purpose of this site is to explore technologies and sometimes indulge in "can I do it" rather then "should I do it.
Initial focus is on layout, styling and data visualization.

Stack so far is:

- Astro as main framework. [Why Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/).
- [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) for graphs.
- [Tailwind](Tailwind) for styling.

## What's great with Astro

Astro has been hyped a lot, and for good reason!

You know how often you just want to start working on a idea, and not get locked into decisions too early?<br>
Particularly if the project is going to be simple initially? Maybe you don't even need any JavaScript?

Out of the box you get a simple, fast framework perfect for content-focused websites. Your first version is up super fast, with HTML and CSS on the same page, similar to Vue.js. You can decide on how to structure your styling later. To start with everything is nicely scoped to one file.

#### Astro's strongest feature is how it scales.

I started with a simple landing page. Tested out layout and designs. The astro files are sufficient as no user interaction is needed. Then I wanted to add some samples from earlier experiment. In this case they where in React, but many developers might have a few different frameworks they would like to integrate in a project. But usually you'd have to rewrite them for one library, maybe even a specific flavour of it.

Astro solves this by letting you use MULTIPLE frameworks at once! I started out with Astro, added a React.js file based on earlier work, then threw in a Solid.js to try it out. And it all works! You can actually change framework on your application file by file.

Like this scenario. I decide I need to add a feature that requires client side rendering. I might already have written the exact thing I need in another language. This is how I added react:

1. Install the plugin `@astrojs/react-‚Å†js`.
2. Import the component to your Astro page.
3. Add the directive `client:only="react"` to the component.
4. Run it!

#### Hydration

Some great features are the directives like `client:load, client:idle, client:visible and client:only` These let you select the priority of how elements load, which helps the site feel much faster.

#### Performance

Astro's gotten a lot of attention because of how well it scales, and reports seems to agree: [Web framework performance report](https://astro.build/blog/2023-web-framework-performance-report/). The key is to minimize JavaScript, and only serve server side rendered CSS and HTML when possible.
